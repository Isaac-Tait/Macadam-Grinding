# Macadam Grinding #

I built this site shortly upon returning to the USA after living in Japan for three and a half years. Eventually the cost (both time and $$$) got too great to justify running four websites [Fallfish Tenkara, Cutthroat Tenkara, Mountain Top Coding, and this site - Macadam Grinding]. 

## Revelations ##

Then I started getting interested in coding, very interested. I started with JavaScript which lead me to React which lead me to Gatsby. However, while all those technologies are very cool they are very complex. I am a firm believer in less code is better code. That is how I came to fall in love with Svelte, which is what this site is built upon.

### Opinion ###

I am currently reading Cory Doctorow's trilogy (as of October 2020 I am in the midst of the first book - "Little Brother"). I read an article in Wired about this trilogy and something the author said really stood out to me: 

“If you found yourself in tech because you were excited by how much self-determination and power and pleasure you got from mastering technology, and then found your entire professional life devoted to ensuring that no one else ever felt that, this is the time for your moral reckoning.” 

While my sites will hardly change the world, they are building blocks. Maybe someday I will build something that has the power to change the world. Right now there is so much hate in our world. We are drowning in it. Just today I read that a school teacher in Paris was beheaded because she allowed a student to show a drawing of Muhammad...

#### Gravel Grinding #####

You can spend a lot of money on a bike but it does not mean you will be faster or go further. I have done plenty on my sub 1k gravel bike. Oftentimes technology can be a crutch. Take 5g for example with up to 4gbps download speeds. With speeds that fast there is zero incentive for coders to write minimally. I forsee coders getting sloppy and while their product will work fine in areas with 5g other areas will be left with less and less accessible websites...

So, that is why I am striving to build this site as Svelte as possible. If you would like to contribute please feel free to. Cheers.
